# Meat and Rice
### by Mason Hartweger

This is my incredibly basic recipe for meat and rice. I am a terrible cook, but these ingredients are usually laying around somewhere (aside from the meat). This is easy and quick to make, and it is great when you are in a time-crunch/hungry.

## Ingredients You Will Need (1 Serving)

**These ingredient amounts are approximations, and please feel free to add more or less depending on your preference.**

*   1 tablespoon of chili flakes
*   olive oil
*   1 tablespoon of salt
*   1 tablespoon of pepper
*   1/2 cup of rice
*   1/8 stick of salted butter
*   1 raw hamburger patty
*   1 tablespoon of garlic
*   "handful" of diced onions

## Instructions to Follow
-   Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a pot
-   Add rice
-   Let rice cook for 15-20 minutes with top on
-   Mash the ground-beef (or hamburger) with your hands
-   After "mashing," ensure that the individual chunks are not that large
-   Put olive oil in pot, and turn on stove heat
-   Put meat into pot, and begin to stir
-   After 5 minutes, put the onions in
-   Add salt, pepper, and chili flakes immediately after
-   Continue stirring (adding additional seasoning if necessary)
-   Continue to cook for 5-10 more minutes or until meat is cooked well
-   Take pot with onions, meat, and seasoning off heat
-   Take rice off heat (when evidently cooked) and drain water
-   Add butter and a small amount of salt/pepper to the rice
-   Put meat on top of rice, and serve

Thanks for reading this terribly over-explained recipe! I cannot cook to save my life. Enjoy!
