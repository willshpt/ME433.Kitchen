# Gnocchi Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 peeled potatoes
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 egg
## Steps
- Boil your potatoes until cooked and peel.
- Mash your potatoes
- Lay your flour into a pile on your work surface and shape it into a crater with a well in the middle.
- Add your mashed potatoes and the egg into the well.
- Break the yolk and mix the egg a bit.
- Start mixing with your hand, slowly combining the wet ingredients with the flour from the inside to the out.
- Knead the dough until it is no longer sticky, if everything is incorporated and it is still sticky, gradually add more flour and knead.
- Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a good amount of salt.
- Cut the dough into fourths and roll each quarter into long ropes. Using a knife or bench scraper cut the dough into little pillows.
- Add the gnocchi into the water and let cook for a couple of minutes. Make sure to bump them with some kind of utensil to make sure they aren't sticking to the bottom.
- The gnocchi will tell you when they are ready by floating to the top of the water. Skim them off and add more gnocchi until the batch is done.
- Saute with your preferred sauce in a skillet and serve.
